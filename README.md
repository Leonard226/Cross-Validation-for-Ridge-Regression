Short description: <br>
Given a labeled data set $D_{train}=\{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x_i \in \mathbb R^d$, $y_i \in \mathbb R$, and $n \gg d$. We choose the optimal hyperparameter $\lambda \in (0.1, 1, 10, 100, 200)$ using $K$-Fold Cross-Validation algorithm to solve the Ridge Regression problem.
